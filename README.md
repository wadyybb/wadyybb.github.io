LEEM, or Locational Emissions Estimation Methodology, is a big data emissions estimation product developed by researchers at Wayne State University in Detroit, MI (USA) and driven by the vision of environmentally sensitive electricity (ESE).  

LEEM automatically tracks, organizes, normalizes, analyzes, and reports location-specific, real-time and forecasted marginal emissions information that empowers utility services, energy users, data and energy management firms, government, and individuals to predict emission levels and estimate costs over time and make better, more informed energy and emission management decisions for the future.

The technology of LEEM has the power to support commercial needs but also provides flexible access for the needs of communities and individuals with three additional products:  
 PEPSO (Polluting Emissions Pump Station Optimization): a software package that performs optimization of large water distribution systems including cost and environmental emissions objectives.
 HERO (Home Emissions Read-Out): an android app that provides up-to-the minute marginal emissions information to your smartphone or email.
 SmartCharge: a tool for rechargeable household devices that operates in response to the marginal emissions information provided to the charger through a wireless connection.    

The LEEM business model includes the sale of LEEM-enabled products and software, as well as the direct sale/licensing of the marginal emissions data stream for user-designed applications.
